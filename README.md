# OnPrem-SiteTemplatingCmdlets
On premise Cmdlets for adding artefacts to an existing SharePoint site.

The cmdlets found here are for scripting site provisioning instead of using templates.
Provision an OOTB site using New-SPSite/ New-SPWeb and then add in artefacts such as lists, libraries, folders, content types, views, etc.
